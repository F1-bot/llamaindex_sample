# Lab Work: AI Agents with LlamaIndex and LlamaHub

This repository contains the code for a lab assignment on developing AI agents using the LlamaIndex framework. The project implements three different agent examples, each using specific tools to solve particular tasks.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: **"Scientific Digest" Agent**. This agent uses `ArxivToolSpec` to search for scientific articles on Arxiv.org, analyzes them, and creates a report in the `multimodal_llm_digest.md` file.
- `researcher_programmer_agent.py`: **"Researcher-Programmer" Agent**. This agent combines `WikipediaToolSpec` for information retrieval with custom tools for writing and executing Python code. It saves its work (scripts and reports) in the `code_output/` directory.
- `foxtrot_scraper_agent.py`: **"Foxtrot Scraper" Agent**. This agent uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to parse products from the foxtrot.com.ua website and saves the results in the `foxtrot_capybara_full_report.md` report.
- `requirements.txt`: A file containing all the necessary Python libraries to run the projects.
- `multimodal_llm_digest.md`: An example report generated by the agent from `main.py`.
- `foxtrot_capybara_full_report.md`: An example report generated by the agent from `foxtrot_scraper_agent.py`.
- `code_output/`: The directory where the "Researcher-Programmer" agent stores its artifacts.
  - `mission_report.md`: An example report generated by the agent from `researcher_programmer_agent.py`.

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Install Ollama

A locally running language model via the Ollama service is required for the agents to work.

- Visit [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/) and install the service for your OS.
- After installation, download the required model. The examples use `qwen3:8b`.
  ```bash
  ollama pull qwen3:8b
  ```
- Ensure the Ollama service is running in the background.

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (example for Linux/macOS)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the Agents

You can run any of the three scripts. Make sure the Ollama service is running.

```bash
# Run the agent for searching scientific articles
python main.py

# Run the researcher agent
python researcher_programmer_agent.py

# Run the scraper agent
python foxtrot_scraper_agent.py
```

After execution, each script will create or update its corresponding report file.
